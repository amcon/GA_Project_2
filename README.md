### Introduction

This is an application for a guitar player who doesn't want/need to pay for sheet-music, who wants a place to get new tabs/chords and have the ability to have a favorites page where she can reference and rate tabs for future reference.

### Interaction Design 

A new user will create a username with a corresponding password.
Once the username has been created, she can now log into the application.
She is directed to a page to either see her favorites or create a 
new search. The user searches by song title, and a tab reference, 
information, and YouTube link. She can also save results into favorites
and delete. 

The application uses MongoDB as a local database and Heroku.
